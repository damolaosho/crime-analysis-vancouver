# crime-analysis-Vancouver

Crime analysis is an essential component of law enforcement and public safety. It involves examining historical crime data to identify patterns, trends, and potential hotspots. Such analyses help law enforcement agencies allocate resources effectively, deploy officers to high-risk areas, and develop proactive strategies to reduce crime rates and enhance public safety.

 
PROBLEM DEFINITION:
This project aims to perform a comprehensive crime analysis on the Vancouver dataset to understand crime incidents in the city.

The aim of this analysis is to know the following:
1. What neighbourhoods are mentioned in this dataset
2. What is the highest crime committed across the dataset
3. How many crimes were committed in these neighbourhoods
4. What year had the most crimes
